# Amazon Clone - Basic Front-End Replica

## Overview

This repository contains a basic front-end clone of the Amazon website's homepage. It focuses on replicating the core layout, navigation, and styling using HTML and CSS. This project was created as a learning exercise to practice front-end development skills, particularly in HTML structure, CSS layout techniques (like Flexbox and potentially Grid), and responsive design principles.

## **Key Features Implemented:**

* **Navigation Bar:** Replicated the top navigation bar with the Amazon logo, address selector, search bar, sign-in/account links, returns & orders, and the cart.
* **Address Section:** Implemented the "Deliver to" address selection.
* **Search Bar:** A functional-looking search bar with a category dropdown.
* **Account & Lists and Returns & Orders:** Static representations of these navigation links.
* **Shopping Cart:** A static cart icon and link.
* **Panel Navigation:** The secondary navigation bar with links like "Today's Deals," "Customer Service," etc.
* **Hero Section:** The main banner image and the informational message at the bottom.
* **Shop Section:** A grid layout of product category boxes with images and "See more" links.
* **Sign-in Suggestion:** The section prompting users to sign in for personalized recommendations.
* **Basic Styling:** Applied CSS to closely resemble the visual appearance of the Amazon homepage.

**Note:** This project is a front-end clone only. It does not include any back-end functionality, user authentication, dynamic data fetching, or actual e-commerce capabilities.
